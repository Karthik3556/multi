      One of the boys with whom Deva (Prabhas) plays cricket in the nondescript
      town of Tinsukia in Assam refers to his towering persona as ‘cutout’, a
      word that is commonly used by the star’s fans. Director Prashanth Neel
      uses this throwaway reference to reaffirm that this film, mounted on a
      massive scale, is a celebration of Prabhas’s stardom. At its bare bones,
      Salaar: Part 1 – the Ceasefire is a story of two friends — Deva and
      Varadaraja Mannar aka Varada (a regal, understated Prithviraj Sukumaran) —
      who turn enemies. It is a storyline that Neel has explored earlier. A
      considerable portion of Salaar draws from the director’s earlier Kannada
      film Ugramm; he repackages it in a KGF style, with stylised action
      choreography, and narrates it in the backdrop of a dystopian kingdom named
      Khansaar, depicted in soot-laden monochrome hues.

      Pushpa 2: The Rule is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language action drama film[8]
      written and directed by Sukumar and produced by Mythri Movie Makers in
      association with Sukumar Writings. A sequel to Pushpa: The Rise (2021), it
      is the second installment in the Pushpa film series. The film stars Allu
      Arjun in the titular role, alongside Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh Faasil,
      Jagapathi Babu, Sunil and Rao Ramesh. It follows Pushpa Raj, a
      labourer-turned-red sandalwood smuggler, as he faces growing threats from
      his enemies, including SP Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat.The sequel was
      officially announced in December 2021, shortly before the release of the
      first film, with the title Pushpa 2 and later rebranded as Pushpa 2: The
      Rule with the release of the first film.[9][10] Although a portion of the
      film was initially shot back-to-back with the first film, director Sukumar
      revised the storyline, leading to principal photography beginning in
      October 2022. The film features music composed by Devi Sri Prasad,
      cinematography by Mirosław Kuba Brożek, and editing by Naveen Nooli. Made
      on a budget of ₹400–500 crore,[3][11] it is among the most expensive
      Indian films ever produced. With a runtime of 200–224 minutes,[12][2] it
      is also one of the longest Indian films.[13]
